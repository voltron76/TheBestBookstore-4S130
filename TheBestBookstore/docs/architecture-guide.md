# The Best Bookstore - Architecture Guide

## Overview
The Best Bookstore is built using a layered architecture pattern, separating concerns into different layers: Controllers, Services, Models, and Views. This guide explains how each component works and interacts with others.

## Database Structure
The application uses Entity Framework Core with a Code-First approach. The main database entities are:
- Books
- Authors
- Categories
- Orders
- Users

### Migrations
Located in the `Migrations` folder, these files:
- Define the database schema
- Handle database version control
- Allow for easy database updates
- Create tables and relationships automatically
- Example: When adding a new Book table:
  ```csharp
  CreateTable(
      name: "Books",
      columns: table => new {
          Id = table.Column<int>(nullable: false),
          Title = table.Column<string>(nullable: false),
          // ...other columns
      }
  );
  ```

## Models Layer
Located in the `Models` folder, models:
- Define the data structure
- Contain data annotations for validation
- Represent database tables as C# classes
- Example of a Book model:
  ```csharp
  public class Book
  {
      public int Id { get; set; }
      public string Title { get; set; }
      // ...other properties
  }
  ```

## Services Layer
Located in the `Services` folder, services:
- Implement business logic
- Handle data processing
- Interact with the database through repositories
- Example workflow:
  1. Receive request from controller
  2. Validate data
  3. Process business rules
  4. Call repository methods
  5. Return results

```csharp
public async Task<Book> GetBookByIdAsync(int id)
{
    // Data access and business logic here
}
```

## Controllers Layer
Located in the `Controllers` folder, controllers:
- Handle HTTP requests
- Route user actions to appropriate services
- Return views or API responses
- Example workflow:
  1. Receive HTTP request
  2. Validate input
  3. Call appropriate service
  4. Return view or data

```csharp
public async Task<IActionResult> GetBook(int id)
{
    var book = await _bookService.GetBookByIdAsync(id);
    return View(book);
}
```

## Views Layer
Located in the `Views` folder, views:
- Display data to users
- Use Razor syntax to combine C# and HTML
- Implement the user interface
- Example structure:
  ```cshtml
  @model Book
  <h1>@Model.Title</h1>
  ```

## Data Flow Example
Let's follow how a book is displayed on the website:

1. User requests `/Book/Details/1`
2. Route directs to `BookController.Details(1)`
3. Controller calls `BookService.GetBookByIdAsync(1)`
4. Service retrieves data from database
5. Data is mapped to Book model
6. Controller passes model to view
7. View renders HTML with book details

## Book Database Operations
Books are managed through several steps:

1. **Creation**:
   ```csharp
   // Controller receives POST request
   // Service validates and saves
   // Database updated through Entity Framework
   ```

2. **Retrieval**:
   ```csharp
   // Query database through LINQ
   // Map results to models
   // Return to controller
   ```

3. **Update/Delete**:
   ```csharp
   // Similar flow to creation
   // Includes validation and error handling
   ```

## Error Handling
The application implements:
- Global error handling middleware
- Try-catch blocks in services
- User-friendly error messages
- Logging system

## Security
Implements:
- User authentication
- Role-based authorization
- Input validation
- CSRF protection
- XSS prevention

## Best Practices
The application follows:
- SOLID principles
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Dependency Injection
- Repository Pattern
- Async/Await pattern

## Conclusion
This architecture ensures:
- Separation of concerns
- Maintainable code
- Scalable application
- Testable components
- Clear responsibility boundaries
